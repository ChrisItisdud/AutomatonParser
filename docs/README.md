# AUTOMATON PARSER

This is a currently very WIP programming language/program for simulating automata/finite state machines of different kinds (currently DFAs, NFAs and both non-deterministic and deterministic PDAs). This is primarily intended for teaching purposes, as simulating these automata might give students an easier time while learning the basics of theoretical computer science.

A documentation of the language used to describe the automata called AML (Automaton Markup Language) can be found in amldocs.md.

A documentation of how to create a client using the AML compiler and runtime can be found in amlclientdocs.md.
